      <p>After finishing a long day of grocery shopping for the first time in my life, I realized I had just spend around $300 on solely groceries, expecting my roommates and I to split the expenses equally. After a week, I had yet to receive a penny from either. The ideas of Roomies occurred at this very moment, where having accurate data would convince my roommates to pay equally for our expenses. </p><br>

Roomies allows users to sign up and share a room. This room represents the apartment or home the users share, and should only consist of those who spend money together. After a long day of spending, one can log in, add their receipts which will send a notification to the other roommates, asking if they approve of the purchase. If they approve, then the amount is spread equally to them. If declined, then a feud begins, in which actual human contact has to be done. At the end of the semester, the net totals are posted, illustrating who owes who. </p><br>
